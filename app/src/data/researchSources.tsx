        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Business Impact</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These volumes represent a significant operational burden on Finance Operations teams.
          Manual processing of billing items increases the risk of errors, delays invoice generation,
          and consumes valuable staff time that could be redirected to strategic activities.

        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Automation Opportunity</h4>
        <p>
          Power Automate flows can automate data extraction, validation, and invoice generation
          for these billing items, potentially reducing manual effort by 60-80% while improving accuracy.
